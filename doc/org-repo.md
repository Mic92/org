# Organisation repo

This repository itself is the entry point for documentation on official resources.

Everybody in the [CODEOWNERS](../.github/CODEOWNERS) file has write permission to this repository.
This allows people to get automatic review requests and merge PRs for the files that concern them.

TODO: Enable branch protection to require reviews by code owners.
TODO: Ensure that all files have a code owner

Furthermore, the code owners for the CODEOWNERS file should have permission to give more people write access to this repository.
These people get requested for reviews when new people add themselves to CODEOWNERS, allowing them to give write access when merged.
