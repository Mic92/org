# Nix organisation

This repository aims to document the organisation of official Nix resources, such as:
- Which resources are official (domains, accounts, legal entities, ...)
- Who has permission over which resources (individuals, teams, companies, ...)
- Organisational processes/policies exist (RFCs, permission requests, ...)

This repository is only the _entry-point_ for such documentation.
More detailed organisational documentation can be delegated to other resources.

The goal of this repository is to make organisation transparent, explicit, discoverable and open to change.
Anybody is welcome to open issues/PRs to add/update documentation or propose organisational changes.

## Contribution guidelines

This repository generally doesn't need to follow any specific structure.
Organic evolution of the structure is encouraged.

The information in this repository should be kept up-to-date with the state of reality.
Thus, all organisational changes tracked in this repository should be proposed with a PR,
and the changes should only to be implemented when the PR is merged.
This may be done manually (e.g. by the person merging the PR) or automatically (e.g. using CD).

Unavoidibly it can also happen for reality to deviate from the documentation without a PR.
Thus, all organisational documentation must also have a process for how such deviations can eventually be mitigated.
This may be done manually (e.g. by having a person regularly check the state)
or automatically (e.g. by regularly scraping and comparing the state).
